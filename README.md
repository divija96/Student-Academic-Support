<h1> Student Academic Support </h1>

<p>This is a Java Mini-Project.</br>It helps the student to view academic-related things like course plan, academic calendar, marks in every subject, attendance, etc.</br>
It also allows the faculty to enter the marks and attendance of each and every student. </br>
The faculty also has access to the course plan, weekly timetable, academic calendar, etc. </br>
The project makes use of <b>Tree Maps</b> in a very efficient manner.</p>
